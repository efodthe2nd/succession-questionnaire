The admin panel should have a login, so not just anyone can here.
 
And in the modal that shows the whole letter(also admin side), it has an ugly white scrollbar that’s off brand, can we remove it, make the scroll-in, border radius all the edges, add box shadow to modal.
There should be a button in the modal that’s also clickable when it’s not expanded to export this letter maybe in txt or pdf whatever works best.
Right now if you clip expert all it just downloads an empty array and saves it in .json, fix this.

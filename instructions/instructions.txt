in instructions/images/[input]/ I have images from figma, containing the design and expected questions for the [input] section, your job is to update this app's [input] section to match the questions and text in the figma files.
understand that we have already done the design correctly for the page, there is no need for any design modifications, all i need is text, questions, content, subtitle the way it as arranged in the figma screenshots. ensure you start from [input]_1 image then [input]_2 image, then [input]_3 image and continue if more are seen, ensure you follow the flow of questions.
